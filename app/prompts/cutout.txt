You will receive ONE car image.

Goal:
- Remove the background and keep ONLY the car.
- Output a clean cutout (car with transparent background).

STRICT RULES:
- Preserve the exact car identity (model, shape, trim, color, rims, windows, badges).
- Preserve ALL text exactly as in the input (especially the license plate). Do not modify, translate, or regenerate text.
- Do NOT change viewpoint, perspective, or camera angle.
- Do NOT add or remove parts (no extra spoiler, no different wheels).
- No blur, no repainting, no stylization.

MASK QUALITY:
- Keep fine details: mirrors, antennas, wipers, thin edges.
- Smooth edges without jagged halos. No background color spill.
- Keep original shadows on the car body only if they belong to the car itself; do not keep ground shadow from the original background.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Return a single PNG with transparent background (RGBA).
