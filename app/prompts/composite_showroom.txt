You are doing IMAGE EDITING / COMPOSITING, not generating a new car.

Goal:
Composite the exact same car from Image A onto the showroom background Image B.
Use Image C ONLY as a framing/placement guide (red box). Do NOT copy any car from Image C.

Hard constraints (must):
- Keep the car identity EXACTLY: same make/model/body, same color, same wheels, same windows, same reflections pattern.
- Preserve the original camera angle/perspective of the car from Image A (do NOT rotate to front view).
- Do NOT change or hallucinate text/logos/plates. Keep the license plate exactly as in Image A (no edits, no new numbers).
- Place the car so that it fits the red guide box in Image C:
  - The car should occupy ~80–90% of the guide box width.
  - The car should be centered horizontally on the guide box center.
  - Wheels must touch the floor (no floating).
- Keep Image B background unchanged except for realistic contact shadow under tires and subtle reflection on the floor.

Soft constraints (nice):
- Match lighting color temperature and contrast to Image B.
- Add realistic soft shadow under each tire and a faint floor reflection consistent with the showroom.

Must NOT:
- Do NOT create a different vehicle.
- Do NOT change body proportions.
- Do NOT add extra objects, text, watermarks, or modify the background geometry.

Return only the final composited image.
The car must not look far away. It must appear close to the camera like a dealership photo and fill the scene.
Do NOT change the viewing angle. Keep the exact yaw/pitch/roll of the car from Image A.
License plate must be preserved exactly from Image A. Do not regenerate, translate, blur, or modify it.
Alignment rules:
- Vertical centerline: the midpoint between the front wheels should be centered.
- Ground contact line: both tires must touch the floor plane; no gaps.
